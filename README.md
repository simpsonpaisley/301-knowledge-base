# MongoDB


## What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a database management program. 

Instead of using tables, MongoDB uses collections and documents to store data. 

Documents are made of key-value pairs, like objects, but they can store more different data types.

Collections are sets of documents, which contain data that can't be used over multiple databases.

MongoDB can store large amounts of data, which can be easily stored and retrived.
