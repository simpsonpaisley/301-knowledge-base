## MongoDB

### What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a database management program. 

Instead of using tables, MongoDB uses collections and documents to store data. 

Documents are made of key-value pairs, like objects, but they can store more different data types.

Collections are sets of documents, which contain data that can't be used over multiple databases.

MongoDB can store large amounts of data, which can be easily stored and retrived.

## Express.JS

### What is Express JS?

- Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications.
- It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application.
- It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes.
- Node does not support request handling, HTTP methods or serving files, so this is where Express JS is useful.
- Described as high performance, fast and lightweight.
- Used as a server-side scripting language.
- Faster Server-Side Development: help Node.JS features, express can save a lot of time.
- Middleware: It is a request handler, which have the access to the application's request-response cycle.
- Routing: Refers to how an applications endpoints (URIs) respond to clients requests.
- Templating: creates a HTML template file with less code and render HTML pages.
- Debugging: Express makes it easier as it identifies the exact part where the bugs are
- Written in JS is used for front-end and back end development.
- We can use Express to customise and use it as per our needs.
- It is very fast to link with databases like MySQL, MongoDB etc.
- JavaScript can only work in a web browser. Node JS is an enviroment, which means the JS can run outside the browser - gives you the power to create applications.

## React

The React.js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook. Reactjs is the most popular of programming lnguages at the moment. It's called React because it reacts to changes and updates the state. It's a library that only renders the view for UI.

React build user interfaces and applications quickly and efficiently using less code than you would with JavaScript.

In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent building blocks, like using Lego! These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which, when assembled, create the whole user interface. There is a virtual DOM and the real DOM which React updates

Twitter is an example of creating seperate componets for a whole UI interface.
